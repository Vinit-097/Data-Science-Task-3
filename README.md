# Decision Tree Classifier – Bank Marketing Dataset

This project is a self-learning data science task focused on building a Decision Tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service.

## Objective
To analyze customer demographic and behavioral data and build a classification model using a Decision Tree.

## Dataset
Bank Marketing dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository).

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## What was done
- Loaded and inspected the dataset
- Encoded categorical variables using LabelEncoder
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Trained a Decision Tree classifier using entropy
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualized the trained Decision Tree

## Model Evaluation
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand how Decision Tree classifiers work, the importance of preprocessing categorical data, and how to evaluate classification models effectively.
